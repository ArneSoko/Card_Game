# Card Game
Working on my own card game, and working on making a Python Pygame program to run the game

pygame_test.py is a python module in which I use the Copyrighted E-Card cards from Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor by Nobuyuki Fukumoto to test various functionality for the card game.

The card game in question is still in development, but the basic idea will be that there are 5 "Unit" cards, and some (likely randomized) set of "Movement" cards.
The colour of the suit for "Unit" cards will represent the team, and likely affect something, and the suit for "Movement" cards will describe either an "Attack" or a "Block" value.
The game will be played by pairing a "Unit" with a "Movement" to produce an act of war, and the objective will be to defeat the opponent's units.
